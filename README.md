Small domain-specific adblock list that covers ghost frames, self-ads, tracking, and overkills from other major lists. Use as a supplement of other lists. Should support most adblockers (Tested on uBlock Origin and AdBlock Plus).

To subscribe to it, click [here](abp:subscribe?location=https://austinhuang.me/0131-block-list/list.txt&title=0131List).

I no longer keep a list of websites covered. Please read the list [here](./list.txt) to see what domains are covered.

For support, you can [leave an issue](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/0131-block-list/issues) or [contact me](../contact).
